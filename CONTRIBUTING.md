# Adding new save data

A new folder containing save data should contain all the necessary save files, and a README.md file describing the installation steps.

If the save data is spread across multiple files it is recommended that they be bundled in a zip file.

## If there is existing save data
*And yours is meaningfully different*
For example, a "Good Save" versus an "Evil Save", or meaningfully different skillpoint allocation in a game without an easy ability to respec. 

If there are already subdirectories differentiating the state of savefiles, simply create your own directory and add your savefile to it alongside installation information.

If the existing data is the only data and is not separated into its own subdirectory, make directories describing the state of the existing save file, and describing yours. For instance, "Warrior Save", "Good Save", or whatever descriptor is meaningful to the observed files. Migrate the existing files to its new directory, and set up your files in its own directory.

*And yours is meaningfully more complete, or valid with a new breaking update for the game*
Replace the existing save data with your own and update the installation instructions if necessary. In the merge request explain why the old save data is to be replaced with new save data
